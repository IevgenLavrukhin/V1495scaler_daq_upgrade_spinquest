"v1495acc_em_100_FF05.rbf" -> This firmware emulates the Fermilab main injector signals. It sends a BOS and EOS signal through the G0 and G1 ports of the V1495. It also outputs a 100 MHz square wave each spill through the C port (all 32 channels and identical output). 

"v1495usr_scaler_FF1E_w_emulator.rbf" -> This firmware is exactly the same as the scaler DAQ firmware except this firmware uses the G0 and G1 for BOS/EOS.
